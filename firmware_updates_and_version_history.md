## Latest Firmware

### 0.11.2

[Download Here](https://github.com/dekuNukem/duckyPad/raw/master/firmware/duckypad_v0.11.2.dfu)

* Fixed a bug in keymap parser to allow `SHIFT` and `AltGr` to be pressed simultaneously.

## USB Firmware Updates

You can update duckyPad's firmware via USB, for bug fixes and and/or new features. 

### Enter DFU Mode

Locate the **`DFU`** button on the board:

![Alt text](resources/pics/buttons.jpg)

* Make sure the board is unplugged.

* **`Hold down DFU button`** while plugging it into a computer.

* Once plugged in, you can release the button.

If all went well, the backlight and display should stay off.

### Windows

Download and install the [STM32 DfuSe tool](resources/en.stsw-stm32080_stm32_DfuSe.zip) from this repo. (You can also download it from [the official website](https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stsw-stm32080.html), but it requires creating an account.)

Launch the `DfuSeDemo` software:

![Alt text](resources/pics/dfu_start.png)

In the `Available DUF Devices` section at top left corner, you should see a `STM Device in DFU Mode`.

![Alt text](resources/pics/dfu_available.png)

* If nothing shows up, you might need to install a driver. [Click me for details](https://github.com/dekuNukem/daytripper/blob/master/dfu_driver_install.md)

Press the `Choose...` button and select a firmware file in `.dfu` format.

* [Click me](https://github.com/dekuNukem/duckyPad/raw/master/firmware/duckypad_v0.11.2.dfu) to download the latest firmware (v0.11.2)

* ...or [scroll down](#firmware-version-history) for older firmware versions.

![Alt text](resources/pics/dfu_choose.png)

Press `Upgrade` button to start uploading the new firmware into the microcontroller.

![Alt text](resources/pics/dfu_upgrade.png)

And now the firmware is being updated!

It can take anywhere between a few seconds to a few minutes. Try using a USB hub if it's particularly slow. 

After completion, press **`RESET`** button (or power-cycle) to start using the new firmware. 

### macOS / Linux

Using terminal, install [dfu-util](http://dfu-util.sourceforge.net/) with a package manager. For macOS you can use [Brew](https://brew.sh/):

`brew install dfu-util`

Hold DFU button and connect duckyPad, then run:

`dfu-util --device ,0483:df11 -a 0 -D /path/to/duckypad_firmware.dfu`

After completion, press **`RESET`** button (or power-cycle) to start using the new firmware.
