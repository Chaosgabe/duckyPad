# duckyPad: Do-It-All Mechanical Macropad

[Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/dekunukem/duckypad-do-it-all-mechanical-macropad) | [Official Discord](https://discord.gg/4sJCBx5) | [Getting Started](getting_started.md) | [Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

duckyPad is a 15-key mechanical macropad that helps **consolidate and speed up your workflow** by automating keyboard inputs. 

duckyPad offers a sleek design and features of a high-end mechanical keyboard (**`Hot-swap`**, **`RGB lighting`**, **`USB-C`**), along with macropad-specific innovations such as **`OLED display`**, **`duckyScript`**, **`SD-card storage`**, and more.

When pressed, each key executes a user-created script to automate keyboard actions:

The scripts can be as simple as shortcuts like `Control + C`, or as sophisticated as launching applications, managing livestreams, or even [creating root backdoors](https://github.com/hak5darren/USB-Rubber-Ducky/wiki/Payload---OSX-Root-Backdoor) or [grabbing passwords](https://github.com/hak5darren/USB-Rubber-Ducky/wiki/Payload---download-mimikatz%2C-grab-passwords-and-email-them-via-gmail). It's all up to you!

## Showcase

By **`automating commonly used actions with duckyPad`**, you can streamline and speed up your everyday routine. Here are a few examples:

### Photoshop / CAD 

You can put all your commonly used shortcuts in one place, resulting in a more efficient workflow: 

![Alt text](resources/pics/cad.gif)

### Managing Livestreams 

With the press of a key, you can switch scenes, start/stop stream, start/stop recording, play ads, and a lot more!

![Alt text](resources/pics/obs.gif)

### Launching Applications  

You can set up duckyPad to open your favourite app with the press of a button: 

![Alt text](resources/pics/winapps.gif)

### Security Research

With the ability to automate keyboard inputs, it is possible to take over an entire computer with the push of a button.

This is known as [BadUSB attack](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2014/07/this-thumbdrive-hacks-computers-badusb-exploit-makes-devices-turn-evil/), and it was the original purpose of [duckyScript and USB Rubber Ducky](https://shop.hak5.org/products/usb-rubber-ducky-deluxe).

But of course, it's up to you to decide what to do!

### One-finger Twitch Chat

### Switching Profiles

With all those potential usages, duckyPad supports up to 32 profiles.

Simply press the +/- button to switch between them:

![Alt text](resources/pics/profiles.gif)

### ... and more!

Those are just some examples! You can use duckyPad to do whatever **`you`** want!

## Features

### Mechanical Switches

duckyPad is compatible with Cherry MX-style mechanical switches (3 or 5-pin).

By default, duckyPad comes with **`Gateron Green`** switches, which are linear and clicky.

![Alt text](resources/pics/switch.jpg)

Of course, you can also install your own switches!

### Keycaps

By default, duckyPad comes with 15 blank translucent ABS R4 keycaps that complement the RGB backlight in all conditions:

![Alt text](resources/pics/caps.jpg)

Of course, you can also install your own key caps!

### Hot-swap Sockets

duckyPad supports hot-swapping with Kailh sockets.

You can install/remove the switches by hand, **`no soldering needed`**.

![Alt text](resources/pics/hotswap.gif)

### Per-key RGB backlight

Each key on duckyPad has its own configurable RGB backlight. You can assign them unique colours to suit your needs.

### OLED screen

duckyPad has an OLED screen. It displays current **`profile and key names`**, so you know what each key does at a glance.

* 1.3-inch blue OLED display
* High contrast with true OLED black
* 128 x 64 resolution
* Burn-in prevention

### duckyScript

duckyPad uses [duckyScript](duckyscript_info.md), a simple scripting language for keyboard automation. It was originally developed for [USB Rubber Ducky](https://shop.hak5.org/products/usb-rubber-ducky-deluxe).

duckyScript is easy and straightforward to write, but can also achieve powerful results.

As a simple example, let's say you want to open Task Manager, the script would look like this:

`CONTROL SHIFT ESC`

Wasn't that bad was it? Now when you press the key, duckyPad will execute the script and bring up the task manager, eliminating the need for memorising and pressing a 3-key combo.

![Alt text](resources/pics/task.gif)

Of course, duckyScript can do much more than that!

Here is a multi-line example that open up notepad, types "Hello world", and increases text size:

```
WINDOWS R
DELAY 400
STRING notepad
ENTER
DELAY 400

STRING Hello World!
CONTROL +
REPEAT 10
```

Note how simple and intuitive it is. You can write you own duckyScript very easily to achieve powerful results.

![Alt text](resources/pics/hello.gif)

Whether it's a simple hotkey or multi-line epic, duckyScript is ready to meet all your keyboard automation needs!

### SD Card Storage

duckyPad stores its scripts and settings on a regular microSD card. Compared to other methods:

* MicroSD cards are universal and inexpensive
* Easy to edit and backup
* Up to 64GB supported with FAT32 format

![Alt text](resources/pics/sd.jpg)

### Companion App

duckyPad comes with a companion app for Windows 10, macOS, and Linux. You can use it to:

* Manage profiles
* Manage key names, colours, and arrangements.
* Write, debug, and test-run duckyScript.
* Change, save, and backup configurations.

![Alt text](resources/pics/pcapp.png)

But more importantly, duckyPad app **`respects your privacy`**:

* Fully open-source
* No need to create an account
* No data collection whatsoever
* No internet connection required
* You donâ€™t even have to use it! You can [set up your duckyPad manually](./manual_setup.md).

### USB-C and Device Compatibility

duckyPad uses USB-C connector for maximum device compatibility.

![Alt text](resources/pics/usbc.jpg)

You can use duckyPad out-of-box on nearly anything that supports USB keyboards, **`no driver needed`**. Examples include:

* PC
* Mac
* Linux
* Raspberry Pi (yes i know it's linux too)
* iPhone / iPad
* Android phones and tablets
* Chromebooks
* Game consoles
* and more!

![Alt text](resources/pics/devices.gif)

duckyPadâ€™s firmware can also be easily updated via USB-C for new features and bug fixes.

### Keyboard Layouts

duckyPad supports multiple keyboard layouts:

* QWERTY
* AZERTY (French)
* AZERTY (Belgium)
* Dvorak

More will be available if needed.
