## Shipping

### Shipping Methods

duckyPads will be shipped from **`United Kingdom`**.

If you're already in UK, it will be posted via **[`Royal Mail 1st Class Signed For`](https://www.royalmail.com/sending/uk/signed-for-1st-class)**.

For everywhere else, the default shipping will be **[`Royal Mail International Standard`](https://www.royalmail.com/sending/international/international-standard)**:

* $6
* Untracked
* Typically 1 week for Europe
* Typically 2 weeks for everywhere else
* Proof of posting available

Optionally, you can upgrade to **[`Royal Mail International Tracked & Signed`](https://www.royalmail.com/sending/international/international-tracked-signed)**:

* $14
* End-to-end tracking
* Signature on delivery
* Typically 1 week for Europe
* Typically 2 weeks for everywhere else
* Proof of posting available

Finally, you can also upgrade to **[`DHL Express Worldwide`](https://www.dhl.co.uk/en/express.html)**:

* $45
* Within 3 working days
* End-to-end tracking 
* Signature on delivery

### When will my duckyPad ship?

For **`Early Bird`** backers:

* Shipping will begin after campaign concludes and fund is received. 

* Most likely will be **`early-to-mid December`**.

For regular backers:

* A new production run will take place to produce your boards.

* Most likely will ship **`Jan/Feb 2021`**.

I'm fairly confident with these estimates, however they are subject to change under unexpected circumstances.

### Will I get it by Christmas?

If you're one of the lucky **`early-bird`** backers, your duckyPad will ship after campaign concludes and fund is received.

So let's take a look at the timeline:

* Campaign ends on Nov 30th.

* Kickstarter takes [14 days to collect funds](https://help.kickstarter.com/hc/en-us/articles/360010120934-If-my-project-is-successfully-funded-how-do-I-receive-my-funds-) and transfer to me.

* Shipping will start when fund is received.

Therefore, early-bird shipping will most likely start on the **`week of December 14`**.

So with **`Royal Mail`** shipping, odds of it arriving before Christmas are:

* **`Very likely`** if you're in UK.

* **`Likely`** if you're in Europe.

* **`Possible but unlikely`** for everywhere else.

Of course, you can opt for faster **`DHL Worldwide Express`** shipping for better odds.

Anyway, I would recommend keeping your expectations in check, but hope for the best :)
